# robotic

Write an application that would go through numbers
from 1 to 100.

The application should consist of a single page (multiple pages are optional if
your design requires them) containing a list (table, plain text, etc.) of words:
"Robot* if the number is divisible by 3,
"ICT" if the number is divisible by 5,
"RobotICT if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.
In all other cases, the application should print just the number.
Add other elements like buttons, links, styles, etc., if your design requires - it's optional but
welcomed. The result should be displayed on a page of a running Meteor]S application.

### run the application
```
meteor run
```
